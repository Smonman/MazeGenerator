## How do I use this?

After starting the program you simply type in the values needed on the right side. There will be default values already in place.

- __Width__ is the width of the final maze image in pixels
- __Height__ is the height of the final maze image in pixels
- __Tile size__ is the size of the rows and collumns of the maze in pixel
- __Draw Every Step__ is a fun little feature, that will make the generation of the maze a lot slower, but shows the process of the creation live

After filling in the required values, hit __Generate__ to generate the maze image. After a successfull generation, the maze might be saved by pressing the __Save__ button.

> **Note**: each generation, even with the same input values, might result in a completely different maze.

## Known issue

The __Stop__ feature might crash the program.
